# raku-most-wanted

[Lists](most-wanted/README-wanted.md) of most wanted
[native library bindings](most-wanted/bindings.md),
[modules](most-wanted/modules.md) and
[research](data-sources/README-sources.md) that helped us select them.

Add your wanted module, with an [issue](https://github.com/raku/raku-most-wanted/issues) to justify why you think someone
should work on that.

## Why do this?

To make a distro release useful for "early majority" users, the existing
modules need to be filled out (such as documentation and better error handling), and
many more modules need to be created (or ported from Perl 5) to fill existing
gaps.  This repo's goal is a gap analysis: a listing of what we have, what we
need, and what's blocking module authors from filling all the gaps.


## Editing

Once a module, feature, or binding has been constructed, remove it
from here so that we can focus on the rest.
