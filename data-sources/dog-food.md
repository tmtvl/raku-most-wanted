# Dog Food

These are modules, apps, and procedures that either should be, or already are,
written in Raku.

* Tools to build modules.perl.org (https://github.com/raku/modules.raku.org)
* IRC bots: dalek, phenny, aloha, ilbot
* 'make install' and as much of the build system as possible (nwc10++)
  + Note that special care is needed for cross-compiling
* tools/contributors.pl "and perhaps other things in this directory" (jnthn++)
