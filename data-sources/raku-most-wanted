ExtUtils::Command: Port from Perl 5 (or should that be Shell::Command?)
Email::MIME
HTTP::Response (and likely HTTP::Request too). LWP::Simple is evolving and
    evolving, so maybe there's a need for a full-blown LWP? (Of course!
    Preferably with JavaScript handling at some point..) In the meantime,
    check out WWW::App, which has WWW::Response and WWW::Request as well as
    convenient sugar coating for even easier development.
SSL
Digest::* (preferably with a unified API) - MD5 and SHA256 already exist.
    What other Digests are wanted?
All the boring stuff like PDF, Excel etc
Data formats of all kinds from SOAP, CSV, YouNameIt (ideally Grammar -
    validating - generating - parsing - the whole range)
Net::* - all kinds of networking stuff
A common widget set (Qt, Gtk)
Something like either GD, Imager or Image Magick
GZIP!
Curses[*], Readline - all things terminal-ish
Crypto - GPG etc
Text::Template
Config::Simple
Smart::Match, mebbe with a bit different name?
